      <h1>Hemsley</h1>

      <p>
        Hemsley is a surname. It means something like &ldquo;home, in the
        lee&rdquo; &mdash; where &ldquo;lee&rdquo; in this context refers to the
        sheltered side of something - perhaps a valley. As a
        family name, it's not a bad one. A family should be a safe place, a home,
        and provide shelter.

        The reason this website is here is that the domain <code>hemsley.cc</code>
        is in use by this particular Hemsley family to allow keeping email addresses
        across the inevitable occasional shift of email service provider. It's
        not exciting, but you weren't promised excitement.
